## Level System

The game uses YAML files to define levels. Each level specifies:
- Starting positions for both unicorns
- Platform locations, sizes, and colors
- White and black item positions
- Rainbow location and size

### Current Levels

1. **Level 1 - Getting Started**: Basic platform layout for learning the game
2. **Level 2 - Tower Challenge**: Vertical climbing challenges with tower structures
3. **Level 3 - Maze Runner**: Complex maze-like structure requiring coordination

## Creating Custom Levels

You can create your own levels by creating YAML files named `level4.yml`, `level5.yml`, etc.

### YAML Level Format

```yaml
level:
  name: "Your Level Name"

# Background image (optional)
background:
  image: "background.png"  # Image filename (put in assets/backgrounds/ directory)
  # Set to null or omit this section if no background image

unicorns:
  unicorn1:
    x: 200      # Starting X position
    y: null     # Starting Y position (null = screen center)
  unicorn2:
    x: 600
    y: null

platforms:
  - x: 200              # X position from left
    y: 250              # Y position from bottom of screen
    width: 150          # Platform width
    height: 20          # Platform height
    color: [255, 0, 0]  # RGB color [Red, Green, Blue]
    alpha: 255          # Transparency (0=invisible, 255=opaque) - optional, defaults to 255
  - x: 400
    y: 300
    width: 100
    height: 20
    color: [0, 255, 0]  # Green
    alpha: 128          # Semi-transparent platform
  # Add more platforms...

white_items:
  - x: 250    # X position from left
    y: 300    # Y position from bottom of screen
  # Add more white items...

black_items:
  - x: 500    # X position from left
    y: 200    # Y position from bottom of screen
  # Add more black items...

rainbow:
  x: 300      # X position from RIGHT edge of screen
  y: 300      # Y position from bottom of screen
  width: 200  # Rainbow width
  height: 200 # Rainbow height
```

### Position System

- **Y coordinates**: Measured from the bottom of the screen (0 = bottom, higher values = higher up)
- **Rainbow X coordinate**: Measured from the RIGHT edge of the screen
- **All other X coordinates**: Measured from the left edge of the screen

### New Features

#### Background Images
- Add custom background images to any level by specifying the image filename in the `background` section
- Images should be placed in the `assets/backgrounds/` directory
- Supports common image formats (PNG, JPG, etc.)
- Images are automatically scaled to fit the screen

#### Transparent Platforms
- Use the `alpha` parameter to control platform transparency
- Values range from 0 (completely invisible) to 255 (fully opaque)
- If `alpha` is not specified, platforms default to fully opaque (255)
- Great for creating glass-like platforms or overlapping level elements

### Adding New Levels

1. Create a new YAML file in the `levels/` directory (e.g., `levels/level4.yml`)
2. Follow the format above
3. Update the `max_levels` variable in `main.py` to include your new level count
4. Add any background images to the `assets/backgrounds/` directory
5. Run the game and your new level will be available!

```

## Game Mechanics

### Physics
- **Gravity**: Unicorns fall when not supported
- **Jumping**: Jump strength of -12 pixels with gravity of 0.5 pixels/frame
- **Ground Level**: 100 pixels from bottom of screen
- **Platform Collision**: Smart collision detection prevents falling through platforms

### Sprite Animation
- **15 Animation Frames**: Extracted from the sprite sheet in a 5x3 grid
- **Smooth Animation**: 0.15 frame advancement per update
- **Directional Flipping**: Sprites face the direction they're moving
- **Color Inversion**: Player 2 has inverted colors for distinction

### Items and Scoring
- **White Items**: 20x20 pixel squares for Player 1
- **Black Items**: 20x20 pixel squares for Player 2
- **Score Display**: Real-time score updates at top of screen
- **Item Removal**: Items disappear when collected

### Visual Effects
- **Glitter Particles**: Colorful particles with physics and fading
- **Rainbow Display**: Semi-transparent rainbow with 7 color bands
- **Level Complete Screen**: Celebration message with instructions

## Tips for Players

1. **Communication**: Talk to your partner to coordinate movements
2. **Teamwork**: Help each other reach difficult platforms
3. **Exploration**: Look for all items before heading to the rainbow
4. **Platform Strategy**: Use the climbing ability to reach high platforms
5. **Timing**: Both players need to be in the rainbow simultaneously

## Troubleshooting

**Game won't start:**
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check that `kaitlyn_unicorn.png` is in the `assets/sprites/` directory
- Verify the `levels/` directory contains the level files

**Missing levels:**
- Verify YAML files are in the correct format
- Check that level files are in the `levels/` directory and named correctly (`level1.yml`, `level2.yml`, etc.)
- Ensure background images are in the `assets/backgrounds/` directory

**Performance issues:**
- The game runs at 60 FPS by default
- Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements
